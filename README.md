# Transmitter
The transmitter mustn't have lowpass filter or builtin mpx generator inside. But if transmitter have "MPX IN" or "Composite In" please turn off or settings your transmitter to disable builtin mpx generator for using this software

For testing it is possible to use a simple one transistor FM transmitter design but signal quality and frequency stability are likely to be problems.
