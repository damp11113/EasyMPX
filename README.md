A Stereo encoder for FM transmitters now with RDS and SCA support.

!! Warning !! If you use this software please use with audio processor like stereo tool or hellfire processor. This software haven't composite clipper or composite limiter for protect.

This program can generate mpx signal for FM transmitters to produce stereo transmissions. 
This can you to transmit your own FM stereo signal and can be received with any standard FM stereo radio. 

This software can use only with soundcard supported 192Khz+ samples rates 

# Transmitter
The transmitter mustn't have lowpass filter or builtin mpx generator inside. But if transmitter have "MPX IN" or "Composite In" please turn off or settings your transmitter to disable builtin mpx generator for using this software

For testing it is possible to use a simple one transistor FM transmitter design but signal quality and frequency stability are likely to be problems.
